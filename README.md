Redfin is a real estate brokerage, meaning we have direct access to data from local multiple listing services, as well as insight from our real estate agents across the country. 
That’s why we’re able to give you the earliest and most reliable data on the state of the housing market. We publish existing industry data faster, and offer additional data on tours and offers that no one else has. 
Using the tools below, you can visualize and download housing market data for metropolitan areas, cities, neighborhoods and zip codes across the nation.
All data here is computed daily as either a rolling 1, 4 or 12-week window. The local data is grouped by metropolitan area and by county. 
All of this data is subject to revisions weekly and should be viewed with caution. 
If there are any concerns about the data or questions about metric definitions, please e-mail econdata@redfin.com or press@redfin.com. 
You can download the full dataset here. For more information, we’ve compiled all the definitions for each metric.

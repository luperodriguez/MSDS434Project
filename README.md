# MSDS434Project

The final project consists of building a cloud-native analytics application that is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The goal of this project is to give you the ability to create realistic, working solutions that were created with modern techniques.

Before you begin, read the Sculley et al. (2015) paper to consider technical debt in machine-learning (ML) systems. Access the Sculley et al. (2015) reading through Course Reserves.

Project Selection
A project can use public data from Google BigQuery Dataset Links to an external site.if using BigQuery as the database.  

Alternately, if using AutoML, data can be tutorial data or custom data Links to an external site..

The main idea is for you to think about starting to create a portfolio.

Project Requirements
Source code stored in Github
Continuous Deployment from CircleCI
Data stored in GCP (BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
ML predictions created and served out (AutoML, BigQuery, etc.)
Stackdriver installed for monitoring
Google App Engine serves out HTTP requests via REST API with a JSON payload
Deployed into GCP environment
A two-page, single-spaced paper describing the project as a consultant would describe it to a client during the hand-off phase.
 

Checklist

Redfin is a real estate brokerage, meaning we have direct access to data from local multiple listing services, as well as insight from our real estate agents across the country. 
That’s why we’re able to give you the earliest and most reliable data on the state of the housing market. We publish existing industry data faster, and offer additional data on tours and offers that no one else has. 
Using the tools below, you can visualize and download housing market data for metropolitan areas, cities, neighborhoods and zip codes across the nation.
